Python Components
=================
*A Project where I create some useful Python Components to be reused in future projects*

Gtk3 Components (tls_gtk3)
---------------
### Preferences Menu | WIP 
  > A simple interface that allows for creating and managing application
  > preferences using Gtk3 and JSON Strings
  > 
  > The programmer creates a JSON String containing the default values
  > along with the input type (eg. Text Entry, Radio Buttons, Drop Downs)
  > Passing this into the constructor, a JSON file is created to store the 
  > users preferences and the interface is automatically constructed to allow
  > the user to manage them. If the JSON file is present when the interface is
  > invoked, the values from it will be used instead of the defaults.
